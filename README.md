# 🏓 Gus Pong — A Game in Processing

This project was developed as a final practice for the "Programació Creativa" subject from the UOC's Tècniques d'Interacció Digital i Multimèdia, with the goal of going beyond the basic version by adding multiple screens, realistic physics, sound, and customizable settings.
